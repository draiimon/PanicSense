# Welcome to Poetry!
This will download and install the latest version of Poetry,
a dependency and package manager for Python.
It will add the `poetry` command to Poetry's bin directory, located at:
/opt/render/project/poetry/bin
You can uninstall at any time by executing this script with the --uninstall option,
and these changes will be reverted.

Installing Poetry (1.7.1): Done
Poetry (1.7.1) is installed now. Great!
To get started you need Poetry's bin directory (/opt/render/project/poetry/bin) in your `PATH`
environment variable.
Add `export PATH="/opt/render/project/poetry/bin:$PATH"` to your shell configuration file.
Alternatively, you can call Poetry explicitly with `/opt/render/project/poetry/bin/poetry`.
You can test that everything is set up by executing:
`poetry --version`
