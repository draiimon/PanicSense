Overall Goal of the Project:
Develop a multilingual sentiment analysis system using mBERT combined with Bi-GRU (and optionally, LSTM) to predict emotional responses such as panic, disbelief, fear/anxiety, and resilience from social media data (primarily from Facebook, X (formerly Twitter)) focusing on natural disasters and calamities. The model should handle various forms of informal language such as Taglish, Jejemon, backwards text, and emojis.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Data Collection:

Sources: Collect social media posts or tweets related to disasters (e.g., typhoons, earthquakes) from Facebook and X (Twitter). These posts should contain informal language like Taglish (a mix of Tagalog and English), Jejemon, and other backwards slangs.

Types of Data: Focus on posts that convey emotions during critical events or disasters, such as expressions of fear, panic, disbelief, resilience, or neutral reports.

Preprocessing Steps:

Text Normalization:

Remove any extraneous elements like URLs, mentions (@usernames), hashtags (#), special characters (except emojis that convey sentiment), and extra spaces.

Normalize words, especially Jejemon and backslangs (e.g., ‚Äúpaasa‚Äù becomes ‚Äúfalse hope‚Äù).

Emoji Handling:

Emojis need to be converted into meaningful sentiment representation (e.g., ü•∫ ‚Üí Anxiety, üò± ‚Üí Panic). If emojis are irrelevant, they are discarded.

Tokenization:

Use mBERT tokenizer to split text into tokens. This is critical for understanding the semantic meaning of words in multiple languages.

Lemmatization and Stemming:

Apply lemmatization to bring words down to their root form (e.g., ‚Äúrunning‚Äù becomes ‚Äúrun‚Äù).

Sentiment Labeling:
You need a set of predefined labels for the emotions you want to track, and their specific keywords or phrases for automated annotation.

Sentiment Categories:

Resilience: Content that expresses strength, hope, unity, determination, often religious references.

Example Keywords: "God," "Lord," "pray," "stay strong," "we will survive."

Neutral: Factual information or updates without strong emotional content.

Example Keywords: "The storm is expected to hit at noon," "The weather report says‚Ä¶"

Disbelief: Shock, denial, or surprise.

Example Keywords: "I can't believe this," "Is this real?"

Fear/Anxiety: Expresses concern, uncertainty, or fear about safety.

Example Keywords: "I'm scared," "I'm worried," "Please help."

Panic: Immediate fear or distress, with urgency.

Example Keywords: "We're going to die," "Run!" "Help!"

Model Building:
mBERT (Multilingual BERT):

Use mBERT for its strong capability to handle multiple languages. It has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text in multiple languages, including Tagalog, English, and other Philippine languages, making it ideal for handling Taglish and informal language.

Bi-GRU and LSTM:

Combine mBERT embeddings with Bi-GRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units) to capture context in both forward and backward sequences of the text.

Optionally use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for sequence modeling to remember long-term dependencies in text.

Hybrid Model: The final model will combine mBERT for text embedding and Bi-GRU (or LSTM) for temporal sequence learning.

Training Setup:
Model Architecture:

Input Layer: Text data passed through mBERT tokenizer.

Embedding Layer: Use mBERT for embeddings of tokens.

Recurrent Layer: Use Bi-GRU for capturing sequential dependencies or LSTM for remembering long-term dependencies.

Dense Layer: Apply a dense layer to output the emotion predictions (Resilience, Neutral, Disbelief, Fear/Anxiety, Panic).

Output Layer: Softmax or sigmoid activation for multi-class classification.

Training Process:

Data Split: Split your data into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.

Loss Function: Use categorical cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.

Metrics: Track accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

Hyperparameters:

Learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, hidden layer sizes for Bi-GRU/LSTM, and dropout rates need to be tuned for optimal performance.

Evaluation and Comparison:
Model Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Measure the overall performance (percentage of correct predictions).

Precision: The fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances for each sentiment category.

Recall: The fraction of relevant instances retrieved.

F1 Score: A balanced measure between precision and recall.

Confusion Matrix:

Use a confusion matrix to evaluate how well the model performs across all categories.

Comparison of Models:

mBERT + Bi-GRU vs mBERT + LSTM vs Hybrid Model (mBERT + Bi-GRU).

Graph each model's precision-recall curve, accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix for a clear comparison.

Deployment:
Exporting the Model:

After training, export the trained model as a .pth (for PyTorch) or .h5 (for TensorFlow/Keras) file.

API Deployment:

Use Flask or FastAPI to deploy your trained model via an API. This API will accept input text and return the sentiment prediction (Resilience, Neutral, Disbelief, etc.).

Real-Time Prediction:

For disaster response or emergency alerts, integrate this model into a dashboard to visualize the predictions of emotions in real time as new posts are made.

Performance Monitoring:

Track the real-time performance of the model via accuracy and other metrics.

Ethical Considerations:
GDPR Compliance: Ensure data privacy by anonymizing personal information and complying with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 in the Philippines.

Bias Mitigation: Make sure the dataset is balanced to avoid model bias toward one emotion or language.

Deployment Environment:
AWS or Google Cloud: Depending on your needs, use cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud to host the model, either on a virtual machine (VM) or using serverless functions for real-time inference.

Next Steps:
Prepare your annotated data (manually or using tools like Prodigy/Labelbox).

Proceed with model training and use evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).

Deploy the model via an API and visualize results.

Analyze and compare models (mBERT + Bi-GRU, mBERT + LSTM, and hybrid).
