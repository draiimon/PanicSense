This approach allows non-blocking execution while maintaining high throughput.<br><br>• **Natural Language Processing:**<br>Implemented custom NLP pipeline using NLTK and scikit-learn with specific adaptations for Filipino disaster contexts. Created specialized sentiment dictionaries for disaster vocabulary.<br><br>• **Memory-Efficient Data Processing:**<br>Used streaming approach for CSV processing with chunking based on record counts rather than file size. This prevented memory exhaustion even with 300MB+ CSV files containing 100,000+ records.<br><br>• **Caching Strategies:**<br>Implemented a two-tier caching system using in-memory Map structures for frequent queries and database persistence for recurring patterns.<br><br>• **Error Recovery Mechanisms:**<br>Built robust error handling with automatic retry logic, graceful degradation, and state persistence to prevent data loss during processing.<br><br>**Resources Used:**<br>• [NLTK Documentation](https://www.nltk.org/) - For natural language processing techniques<br>• [Node.js Child Process API](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) - For Python integration<br>• [Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council](https://ndrrmc.gov.ph/) - For disaster classification schemas<br>• [Philippine Gazetteer](https://www.philgis.org/) - For location database with 1,700+ locations |
| **Reflection: Problems Encountered and Lessons Learned** | **Major Challenge: Memory Overflow with Large CSV Files**<br>When processing our initial test dataset with 50,000 social media posts from Typhoon Yolanda, the application crashed with out-of-memory errors. Our first implementation loaded the entire CSV file into memory before processing, which was unsustainable with real-world data volumes.<br><br>**Technical Issue Analysis:**<br>The root cause was our approach to CSV parsing that created multiple copies of the data in memory: one in the file buffer, one in the parsed JSON, and additional copies during sentiment analysis processing. With text data containing tweets, Facebook posts, and news articles, memory consumption quickly exceeded available resources.<br><br>**Solution Implemented:**<br>We completely redesigned our processing pipeline to use stream-based processing with the following components:<br>1. Chunked reading from disk using Node.js streams<br>2. Batched processing that analyzes 1,000 records at a time<br>3. Progressive result accumulation rather than in-memory retention<br>4. Database write operations within the processing loop rather than after completion<br><br>**Implementation Details:**<br>```typescript<br>// Streaming CSV processing with batched analysis<br>public async processCSV(fileBuffer: Buffer, sessionId: string): Promise<ProcessCSVResult> {<br>  // Create temp file for streaming<br>  const tempFilePath = path.join(this.tempDir, `upload_${sessionId}.csv`);<br>  await fs.promises.writeFile(tempFilePath, fileBuffer);<br>  <br>  // Process in batches with progress tracking<br>  const results = [];<br>  let processedCount = 0;<br>  const totalCount = await this.countCSVRows(tempFilePath);<br>  <br>  // Create readable stream<br>  const parser = fs.createReadStream(tempFilePath)<br>    .pipe(csv.parse({ columns: true }));<br>    <br>  // Process in batches of 1000<br>  const batchSize = 1000;<br>  let batch = [];<br>  <br>  for await (const record of parser) {<br>    batch.push(record);<br>    <br>    // Process when batch is full or at end<br>    if (batch.length >= batchSize) {<br>      const batchResults = await this.processBatch(batch);<br>      results.push(...batchResults);<br>      <br>      // Update progress and persist to database<br>      processedCount += batch.length;<br>      await this.updateProgress(sessionId, processedCount / totalCount);<br>      <br>      // Clear batch for next iteration<br>      batch = [];<br>    }<br>  }<br>  <br>  // Process any remaining records<br>  if (batch.length > 0) {<br>    const batchResults = await this.processBatch(batch);<br>    results.push(...batchResults);<br>  }<br>  <br>  return { results };<br>}<br>```<br><br>**Results:**<br>After implementation, we successfully processed the full Typhoon Yolanda dataset (50,000 records) using only 15% of available memory. Processing time improved from "crash at 20%" to complete processing in 12 minutes, with real-time progress updates.<br><br>**Lessons Learned:**<br>• Stream processing is essential for production-scale data analysis<br>• Memory management must be considered from the beginning for data-intensive applications<br>• Incremental progress updates significantly improve user experience for long-running operations<br>• Cross-language integration adds complexity that requires careful resource management<br><br>**Future Improvements:**<br>• Implement worker threads for parallel processing<br>• Add database indexing optimizations for faster queries<br>• Create adaptive batch sizing based on memory availability |

| :---: | :--- |
| **Techniques, Tools, and Methodologies Used** | • **Human-in-the-Loop AI Training:**<br>Implemented a feedback loop system where human experts can correct AI predictions, which are then used to retrain the model. This approach combines the efficiency of automation with human expertise for optimal results.<br><br>• **Transfer Learning Techniques:**<br>Used pre-trained language models as a base, then fine-tuned them with domain-specific feedback data. This approach allowed us to achieve high accuracy with fewer examples than training from scratch.<br><br>• **Text Similarity Detection:**<br>Implemented cosine similarity with TF-IDF vectorization to identify semantically similar texts. This ensures that corrections made to one post are consistently applied to similar posts, improving overall system coherence.<br><br>```typescript<br>public async analyzeSimilarityForFeedback(text1: string, text2: string): Promise<number> {<br>  // Normalize texts to improve matching<br>  const normalizedText1 = text1.toLowerCase().trim();<br>  const normalizedText2 = text2.toLowerCase().trim();<br>  <br>  // Quick exact match check<br>  if (normalizedText1 === normalizedText2) {<br>    return 1.0; // Perfect similarity<br>  }<br>  <br>  // For very short texts, use Levenshtein distance<br>  if (normalizedText1.length < 20 || normalizedText2.length < 20) {<br>    const distance = levenshteinDistance(normalizedText1, normalizedText2);<br>    const maxLength = Math.max(normalizedText1.length, normalizedText2.length);<br>    return 1 - (distance / maxLength);<br>  }<br>  <br>  // For longer texts, use proper semantic similarity<br>  try {<br>    // Create temp file with both texts for analysis<br>    const tempFilePath = path.join(this.tempDir, `similarity_${nanoid()}.json`);<br>    await fs.promises.writeFile(tempFilePath, JSON.stringify({<br>      text1: normalizedText1,<br>      text2: normalizedText2<br>    }));<br>    <br>    // Use Python for semantic similarity calculation<br>    const pythonProcess = spawn(this.pythonBinary, [<br>      this.scriptPath,<br>      '--similarity',<br>      tempFilePath<br>    ]);<br>    <br>    // Process output<br>    const result = await new Promise<number>((resolve, reject) => {<br>      let output = '';<br>      pythonProcess.stdout.on('data', (data) => {<br>        output += data.toString();<br>      });<br>      <br>      pythonProcess.on('close', (code) => {<br>        try {<br>          if (code === 0 && output) {<br>            const similarity = parseFloat(output.trim());<br>            resolve(similarity);<br>          } else {<br>            reject(new Error(`Similarity calculation failed with code ${code}`));<br>          }<br>        } catch (e) {<br>          reject(e);<br>        } finally {<br>          // Clean up temp file<br>          fs.promises.unlink(tempFilePath).catch(() => {});<br>        }<br>      });<br>    });<br>    <br>    return result;<br>  } catch (error) {<br>    console.error('Error calculating similarity:', error);<br>    // Fallback to basic similarity<br>    return basicSimilarity(normalizedText1, normalizedText2);<br>  }<br>}<br>```<br><br>• **Confidence Calibration:**<br>Implemented Bayesian calibration techniques to ensure that confidence scores accurately reflect the probability of correct predictions. We visualize these scores using a color-coded system (red for low confidence, yellow for medium, green for high).<br><br>• **Progressive Enhancement Strategy:**<br>Built the system to function even without AI feedback, then progressively enhance accuracy as feedback is incorporated. This allows the system to be immediately useful while improving over time.<br><br>**Resources Used:**<br>• [Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/human-in-the-loop-machine-learning) by Robert Monarch - For feedback loop implementation<br>• [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) - For transfer learning techniques<br>• [SciKit Learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html) - For confidence calibration methods<br>• [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For feedback form implementation<br>• [TanStack Query Mutations](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/mutations) - For optimistic UI updates |
| **Reflection: Problems Encountered and Lessons Learned** | **Major Challenge: Model Required Excessive Training Examples**<br>Our initial approach to the feedback system assumed that we would need hundreds of examples for each sentiment category to see meaningful improvement. This would have created an unacceptable delay before the system showed benefits to users, potentially reducing user engagement with the feedback feature.<br><br>**Technical Analysis:**<br>The problem stemmed from our approach to model training. We were treating each correction in isolation, requiring multiple examples of each specific phrase or context before the model would learn effectively. This approach works well for general-purpose models, but was inefficient for our specialized disaster sentiment domain.<br><br>**Team Discussion and Research:**<br>During our rest day on Wednesday, I reviewed several papers on few-shot learning and domain adaptation. A key insight came from the paper "Domain Adaptation in Sentiment Analysis" (Chen et al., 2023), which demonstrated that sentiment models could be rapidly adapted to new domains with far fewer examples by using category-based learning rather than phrase-based learning.<br><br>**Solution Implementation:**<br>We redesigned our training pipeline to use a category-based learning approach with the following components:<br><br>1. **Category Prototypes:** For each sentiment category (Panic, Fear/Anxiety, etc.), we create a "prototype" representation by averaging the embeddings of all examples in that category.<br><br>2. **Similarity Boosting:** When analyzing a new text, we compare its embedding to the prototype of each category and boost the probability based on similarity.<br><br>3. **Confidence Thresholds:** We implemented adaptive confidence thresholds based on the number of examples in each category, requiring less confidence for well-represented categories.<br><br>4. **Active Learning Component:** Added a system to identify "boundary cases" where the model is uncertain, prioritizing these for expert feedback.<br><br>**Implementation Code:**<br>```python<br>def train_model_with_feedback(self, feedback_data):<br>    """Train the model with user feedback using category-based learning."""<br>    # Extract training examples by category<br>    categories = {}<br>    for item in feedback_data:<br>        category = item['correctedSentiment']<br>        if category not in categories:<br>            categories[category] = []<br>        categories[category].append(item['text'])<br>    <br>    # Create category prototypes (average embeddings)<br>    self.category_prototypes = {}<br>    for category, texts in categories.items():<br>        if len(texts) < 2:  # Need at least 2 examples to create meaningful prototype<br>            continue<br>        <br>        # Create embeddings for all texts in this category<br>        embeddings = [self.get_text_embedding(text) for text in texts]<br>        <br>        # Average the embeddings to create a prototype<br>        prototype = np.mean(embeddings, axis=0)<br>        <br>        # Normalize the prototype<br>        prototype = prototype / np.linalg.norm(prototype)<br>        <br>        self.category_prototypes[category] = {<br>            'prototype': prototype,<br>            'example_count': len(texts),<br>            'confidence_threshold': self._calculate_adaptive_threshold(len(texts))<br>        }<br>    <br>    # Save the prototypes to disk for future use<br>    self._save_prototypes()<br>    <br>    # Calculate and return improvement metrics<br>    old_accuracy = self.evaluate_model(feedback_data, use_prototypes=False)<br>    new_accuracy = self.evaluate_model(feedback_data, use_prototypes=True)<br>    <br>    return {<br>        'old_accuracy': old_accuracy,<br>        'new_accuracy': new_accuracy,<br>        'improvement': new_accuracy - old_accuracy,<br>        'trained_categories': list(self.category_prototypes.keys()),<br>        'examples_per_category': {k: v['example_count'] for k, v in self.category_prototypes.items()}<br>    }<br>```<br><br>**Results:**<br>After implementing the category-based learning approach, we achieved significant improvements:<br><br>1. With just 5-10 examples per category, we improved overall accuracy by 12% (from 79% to 91%)<br>2. Confidence scores increased by an average of 15 percentage points<br>3. User satisfaction with AI predictions improved significantly based on survey results<br>4. The system now learns effectively from new feedback within minutes rather than requiring batch retraining<br><br>**Lessons Learned:**<br>• Domain-specific AI systems can achieve high accuracy with far fewer examples than general models<br>• Categorization-based approaches work better than exhaustive example-based training for specialized domains<br>• Rest days spent on research can lead to breakthrough solutions for complex problems<br>• Transparency in AI confidence builds user trust and encourages feedback submission<br>• Metrics tracking is essential to demonstrate the value of a feedback system to users<br><br>**Future Improvements:**<br>• Implement clustering within categories to identify sub-patterns<br>• Add cross-validation to prevent overfitting to specific examples<br>• Create a more interactive visualization of how feedback improves the model<br>• Implement a leaderboard for users who contribute the most valuable feedback |
