Research Objectives 
The pursuit of this objective is undertaken to provide a comprehensive response to the given question.
General Objectives
This study aims to predict public panic behavior during natural disasters by analyzing social media data through neural network models, with a focus on textual sentiment analysis in both Tagalog and English languages.
Specific Objectives 
Identify and examine the correlation between dominant emotional sentiments on social media platforms (e.g., Facebook and X (twitter)) and indicators of panic behavior.
Develop a neural network model to analyze real-time social media data for detecting emotional sentiments during natural disasters.
Implement a multilingual sentiment analysis model in Tagalog and English to improve prediction accuracy for public panic behavior.
1.4	Research Questions
This question aims to improve disaster response capabilities by analyzing social media sentiment through a hybrid multilingual neural network model. The following research questions guide the investigation:
How can the dominant emotional sentiments expressed on social media during natural disasters be identified, and how do these sentiments correlate with panic behaviors?
How can panic predictions assist disaster response teams in making timely decisions and allocating resources effectively?
How does a hybrid multilingual neural network model enhance the accuracy and applicability of sentiment analysis for disaster management in a bilingual context?
These questions focus on understanding key emotional trends, exploring the practical applications of panic predictions for response teams, and evaluating the effectiveness of a hybrid multilingual approach in enhancing sentiment analysis accuracy during disasters.
 1.5	Significance of the Study 
The significance of this study lies in its application of an Hybrid Neural Network model for real-time, multilingual sentiment analysis of social media data during natural disasters. By examining bilingual (English and Filipino) data from platforms like Facebook and Twitter (X), this study aims to provide actionable insights into the primary emotions expressed by the public, “suggestively” mapped on the Panic Spectrogram: disbelief, panic, anxiety, fear, resilience, confusion, helplessness, urgency, and frustration. This approach not only enhances the understanding of public emotional responses in crises but also equips disaster management teams with essential tools to improve crisis response and communication strategies in the Philippines.
This research allows disaster response teams to better anticipate and manage emotional trends within the population, such as heightened panic or emerging resilience, which can have substantial effects on public safety behaviors and overall crisis management. The findings enable authorities to adjust their communication strategies and disaster response efforts in alignment with real-time emotional indicators, providing a clearer picture of public sentiment as disaster events unfold. By tracking these emotional patterns over time, the study contributes to the development of a proactive approach to disaster management that mitigates panic, fosters resilience, and promotes overall community preparedness.
The primary beneficiaries of this study include:
National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC): This study provides NDRRMC with actionable, real-time insights into public emotional responses, enabling them to craft culturally relevant communication strategies that enhance crisis response, reduce public panic, and promote resilience. By identifying bilingual sentiment patterns mapped on the Panic Spectrogram, this study reflects diverse emotional expressions, supporting more informed decision-making.
Public Information Agencies: Equipped with emotion-based insights, public communication teams can refine messaging to address fears, counter misinformation, and strengthen public trust in official advisories. The bilingual analysis ensures these agencies accurately capture and respond to the emotional landscape across languages, creating more inclusive and effective crisis communication.
Future Researchers: This study establishes a comprehensive framework for using advanced neural networks for multilingual sentiment analysis in disaster management, focusing on emotions mapped to the Panic Spectrogram, such as panic, anxiety, confusion, and resilience. This supports further research in machine learning, natural language processing, and social media analysis, offering a validated approach to multilingual sentiment tracking in crisis contexts.
Local Government Units (LGUs) and Community Leaders: The methods developed in this study aid regional disaster response by helping local authorities and community leaders better understand and address the emotional needs of their communities. By capturing bilingual sentiment, this research enhances the ability of LGUs to tailor their crisis response strategies to the specific emotional climate of the communities they serve.
Additionally, while focused on the Philippines, the study’s findings can serve as a model for other disaster-prone regions aiming to leverage real-time emotion analysis for improved crisis preparedness. By integrating multilingual sentiment analysis with advanced neural networks, this research contributes to the fields of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, demonstrating how sentiment tracking mapped on the Panic Spectrogram can address complex, real-world challenges in disaster management.
1.6	Scope and Limitations
This study aims to predict public panic behavior during natural disasters in the Philippines by analyzing social media data from platforms such as Facebook, X (Twitter), with a focus on posts, comments, and reactions from 2019 to the present. By examining emotional reactions in both English and Tagalog, the research seeks to provide disaster management authorities with valuable insights into the emotional state of the population, enabling better anticipation of public responses like panic buying or refusal to evacuate, and enhancing crisis communication strategies.
To gather and process data effectively, the study utilizes various API integrations for social media platforms, specifically Apify, the X Developer API, and other relevant sources. Emoticons, which are commonly used in social media posts, are converted into text format using Hugging Face NLP packages and additional sentiment lexicons. This approach ensures accurate multilingual sentiment capture, providing a comprehensive view of public emotions across both Tagalog and English. The study follows strict ethical guidelines, with data limited to publicly available content and analyzed in aggregate, without individual-level behavioral tracking.
Main Components of the Study
Data Collection Module: This module gathers social media data through APIs, specifically using Apify for web scraping and the X Developer API for Twitter data, focusing on keywords like "bagyo" (typhoon) and "lindol" (earthquake). By collecting posts, comments, and reactions in both English and Tagalog, the module provides a multilingual dataset that captures the emotional responses of the Filipino population during disasters. Emoticons are converted to text using Hugging Face NLP packages and sentiment lexicons, allowing the analysis to reflect the full range of emotional expressions commonly used on social media.
Panic Sentiment Correlation Module: This module maps and analyzes public emotions based on categorizing suggestive emotions like disbelief, panic, anxiety, fear, resilience, confusion, helplessness, urgency, and frustration. By correlating these emotions with potential panic behaviors, the module generates real-time predictions of behavioral shifts, such as increased anxiety or urgency. These insights assist disaster management teams in interpreting emerging emotional trends and adapting communication strategies. However, further integration with existing protocols may be required to ensure that insights lead to actionable responses during crisis events.
Multilingual Neural Network Model Module (mBERT + Hybrid Bi-GRU & LSTM): This module uses a hybrid neural network model combining mBERT for multilingual understanding with Bi-GRU and LSTM networks. mBERT processes both Tagalog and English text effectively, capturing language-specific sentiment nuances. The Bi-GRU component captures immediate emotional context by analyzing bidirectional data flow, while the LSTM component models longer-term emotional changes, providing insights into sustained public reactions over time. Future improvements could include integrating data from additional platforms and refining the model to handle more linguistic variations across dialects.
