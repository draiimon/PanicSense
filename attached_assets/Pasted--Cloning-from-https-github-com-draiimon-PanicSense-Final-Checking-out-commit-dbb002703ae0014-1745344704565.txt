Compiling TypeScript files...
                                                                               
                This is not the tsc command you are looking for                
                                                                               
To get access to the TypeScript compiler, tsc, from the command line either:
- Use npm install typescript to first add TypeScript to your project before using npx
- Use yarn to avoid accidentally running code from un-installed packages
