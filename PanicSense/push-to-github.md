# How to Push All Code to GitHub

I understand you want to push all code to GitHub, not just Docker files. Due to security restrictions in Replit, we need to use a direct approach:

## Method 1: Download Your Code Files

1. In the Replit file browser, right-click on the root directory (or individual key folders)
2. Select "Download as zip"
3. This will download all your code to your local computer

## Method 2: Use GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/draiimon/PanicSense-Docker
2. Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop the code files from your downloaded zip
4. Commit the changes directly to main branch

## Method 3: Use GitHub Desktop

1. Download your code as in Method 1
2. Use GitHub Desktop to clone your repository
3. Replace all files with the downloaded ones
4. Commit and push the changes

## Main Folders to Upload

Make sure to include these key folders and files:
- `client/` - Contains all frontend React code
- `server/` - Contains backend API and services
- `python/` - Contains AI/ML processing logic
- `shared/` - Contains shared types and schemas
- Configuration files in the root directory

These contain the core of your application, not just Docker configuration files.
