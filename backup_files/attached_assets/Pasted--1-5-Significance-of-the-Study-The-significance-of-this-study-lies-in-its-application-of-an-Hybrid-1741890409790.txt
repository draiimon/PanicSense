 1.5	Significance of the Study 
The significance of this study lies in its application of an Hybrid Neural Network model for real-time, multilingual sentiment analysis of social media data during natural disasters. By examining bilingual (English and Filipino) data from platforms like Facebook and Twitter (X), this study aims to provide actionable insights into the primary emotions expressed by the public, “suggestively” mapped on the Panic Spectrogram: disbelief, panic, anxiety, fear, resilience, confusion, helplessness, urgency, and frustration. This approach not only enhances the understanding of public emotional responses in crises but also equips disaster management teams with essential tools to improve crisis response and communication strategies in the Philippines.
This research allows disaster response teams to better anticipate and manage emotional trends within the population, such as heightened panic or emerging resilience, which can have substantial effects on public safety behaviors and overall crisis management. The findings enable authorities to adjust their communication strategies and disaster response efforts in alignment with real-time emotional indicators, providing a clearer picture of public sentiment as disaster events unfold. By tracking these emotional patterns over time, the study contributes to the development of a proactive approach to disaster management that mitigates panic, fosters resilience, and promotes overall community preparedness.
The primary beneficiaries of this study include:
National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC): This study provides NDRRMC with actionable, real-time insights into public emotional responses, enabling them to craft culturally relevant communication strategies that enhance crisis response, reduce public panic, and promote resilience. By identifying bilingual sentiment patterns mapped on the Panic Spectrogram, this study reflects diverse emotional expressions, supporting more informed decision-making.
Public Information Agencies: Equipped with emotion-based insights, public communication teams can refine messaging to address fears, counter misinformation, and strengthen public trust in official advisories. The bilingual analysis ensures these agencies accurately capture and respond to the emotional landscape across languages, creating more inclusive and effective crisis communication.
Future Researchers: This study establishes a comprehensive framework for using advanced neural networks for multilingual sentiment analysis in disaster management, focusing on emotions mapped to the Panic Spectrogram, such as panic, anxiety, confusion, and resilience. This supports further research in machine learning, natural language processing, and social media analysis, offering a validated approach to multilingual sentiment tracking in crisis contexts.
Local Government Units (LGUs) and Community Leaders: The methods developed in this study aid regional disaster response by helping local authorities and community leaders better understand and address the emotional needs of their communities. By capturing bilingual sentiment, this research enhances the ability of LGUs to tailor their crisis response strategies to the specific emotional climate of the communities they serve.
Additionally, while focused on the Philippines, the study’s findings can serve as a model for other disaster-prone regions aiming to leverage real-time emotion analysis for improved crisis preparedness. By integrating multilingual sentiment analysis with advanced neural networks, this research contributes to the fields of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, demonstrating how sentiment tracking mapped on the Panic Spectrogram can address complex, real-world challenges in disaster management.
