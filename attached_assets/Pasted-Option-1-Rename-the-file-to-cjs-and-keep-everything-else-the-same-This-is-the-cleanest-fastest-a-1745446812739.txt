Option 1: Rename the file to .cjs and keep everything else the same
This is the cleanest, fastest, and Render-compatible fix. No need to rewrite imports or restructure your project.

ðŸ”§ Step-by-step guide:
1. Rename the file
Change the file name:

arduino
Copy code
render-setup.js â†’ render-setup.cjs
âœ… This tells Node to treat the file as CommonJS, which allows the use of require().

2. Update your package.json scripts (if applicable)
If you are running the script via npm run or similar, update the reference:

json
Copy code
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node render-setup.cjs",
    "build": "node render-setup.cjs"
  }
}
âœ… If you're not calling it from a script, and Render is just running node render-setup.js directly in the "Build Command", change that command too:

3. Change your Render Build Command:
Go to Render > Your Service > Build Command and update:

arduino
Copy code
node render-setup.js
to:

arduino
Copy code
node render-setup.cjs
ðŸŽ‰ That's it!
You donâ€™t have to touch any import or require, no need to mess with "type": "module" in your package.json, and this fix works instantly with Renderâ€™s build process.

ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead
This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and '/opt/render/project/src/package.json' contains "type": "module". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension.
